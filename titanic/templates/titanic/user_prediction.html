    <h2 class="text-center">Some facts (for impacient people)</h2>

    <p>You increase your probability of survive if:</p>

    <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
        <li class="list-group-item">You are a women o children</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">You travel on better class</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">You pay more (related to travel on better class)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="text-center">Why I get this result? (long explanation)</h2>

    <p>
        This result was obtained using Machine Learning Logistic Regressor over Titanic dataset. The software
        learn patterns, create a model and classify a person on surviver or not based on data. Obviously, this 
        result is not 100% accurately, but helps in some cases.
    </p>

    <p>
        On Titanic accident, some people survived with more probability than others. If you
        make a Data Analysis to Titanic dataset, you can discover that some features are 
        correlated with survived probability. Let's see this fact using Pearson Correlation 
        Coeficients on Correlation Matrix and Heat Map:

    <p>
        If two features are correlated, the value of the cell is near 1 (perfect direct correlation) or -1 (perfect inverse correlation).
        If the value of the cell is near to cero, means that the features are not correlated.
        Getting the absolute values from Survived column on Correlation Matrix and sorting descendant, can obtain the most correlated values
         with survive:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Sex: 0.53</li>
        <li>Passenger Class: 0.31</li>
        <li>Fare: 0.24</li>
        <li>Embarked: 0.18</li>
        <li>Number of parents or children: 0.08</li>
        <li>Age: 0.06</li>
        <li>Slibings and spouses: 0.03</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        There are a correlation between sex, passenger class, fare and survive features on dataset.
        Other variables has a correlation with survive feature, but is weak. We can conclude,
        based on data, that sex, passenger class, and fare are the most important features
        to survive on Titanic accident. The others variables matter, but on minor importance.

        Imagine, for a moment, that was an accident. How is prioritized? How is rescated first? <strong>Woman and childrens</strong>.
        Who have the more probability to reach lifeboat? Passengers on Third or <strong>First Class</strong>? Sad but true..
        Other features are correlated with survive probability, but the importance is less. Like age, number of slibings or spouses..
